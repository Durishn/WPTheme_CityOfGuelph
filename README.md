# TwentyTwelve-CityOfGuelph
This repository holds all the code for the custom-built WordPress theme which runs the City of Guelph municipal website. The theme was built as a child theme of the popular Twenty Twelve wordpress theme

## Installation
Download this theme via WP Pusher or by pulling the repository and dropping it in the themes folder along with the twenty twelve theme.

## Development
While changes can indeed be made by editing files directly within this window, it should be done with caution. Significant changes should be performed within a development branch before being merged into master(prod). Once in master, this change is available to all sites that use the twentytwelve-cityofguelph theme.

## Testing
- We don't have any tests or lints currently, but in the future merges into master may require passing automated tests. Each test will be explained in more detail as it is added.

## Publishing
Once changes are in master, they can be pulled into Guelphs Wordpress installations by 'updating' the theme.

## Versioning
We aim to use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/CityOfGuelph-Webservices/TwentyTwelve-CityOfGuelph/tags).
