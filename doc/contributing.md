## Tips for Development

### SCSS

Styling a website is a an art, as is structuring those styles. Take consideration
in the priviledge level of your styles and their files location within the
SCSS. We are currently trying to seperate guelph.ca specific styles from
those within the Guelph Design System - so keep components, templates, and
overrides seperated! To compile your scss after making a change, use a Sass compiler
with minification such as `sass scss/style.scss css/gds-design-system.css --style compressed`.
